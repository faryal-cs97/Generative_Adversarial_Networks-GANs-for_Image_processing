# Generative_Adversarial_Networks-GANs-for_Image_processing

Welcome to my Image Generation System project developed as part of my remote internship with Internee.pk. This repository implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic images based on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

# 1. Overview

This project demonstrates:

The creation and training of a GAN for generating images.
Techniques for dataset preprocessing, model optimization, and result visualization.
Tools and methods to control the attributes of generated images.

# 2. Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset was used, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items. These were preprocessed to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.

# 3. Implementation Steps

1. Environment Setup

Install dependencies:
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib

Enable GPU memory growth for better performance (if applicable).

2. Data Preparation

Load and preprocess the Fashion MNIST dataset:
Scale pixel values to the range [0, 1].
Shuffle and batch the dataset for efficient training.

3. Build the Generator

The generator uses a series of upsampling and convolution layers to transform random noise into meaningful images.

4. Build the Discriminator

The discriminator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as real or fake.

5. Combine into GAN

Use a custom training loop to alternately train the generator and discriminator, ensuring stable learning.

6. Compile and Train

Define optimizers and loss functions for both models.

Train the GAN for 5 epochs on the dataset.

7. Generate and Visualize Results

Generate images from the trained generator.

Visualize the outputs using matplotlib.

# 4. Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/generative-ai-project.git

cd generative-ai-project

Install the required libraries:

pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib

# 5. Usage

Run the script to train the GAN:

python train_gan.py

To visualize generated images:

python generate_images.py

# Results

Sample Generated Images:

Below are examples of images generated by the GAN after training:
